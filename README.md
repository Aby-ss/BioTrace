# BioTrace

BioTrace emerges as a pioneering solution to address the challenge of monitoring biodiversity in wetlands. Comprising an integrated system of camera traps and sound sensors, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of animal detection, especially during nocturnal hours. The central focus revolves around creating a comprehensive setup that can seamlessly collect data, utilize AI for animal identification, and record population counts.

## üì∑ Camera Technology Selection

The project delves into the selection of camera traps equipped with night vision capabilities. These cameras are strategically chosen for their high-resolution imaging, infrared functionalities, and motion detection features, ensuring precise capture even in low-light conditions. By integrating this technology, BioTrace aims to cover a wide range of species while minimizing disturbances in their natural habitat.

## üé§ Sound Sensors Integration

In tandem with camera traps, the incorporation of sound sensors further amplifies the system's efficacy. These sensors are strategically placed to detect unique animal vocalizations and environmental sounds. By capturing audio data, BioTrace expands its scope to identify and track species that might not be visible in the camera's frame, providing a holistic approach to biodiversity monitoring.

## üìç Optimal Installation Sites

Careful consideration is given to the placement of these devices. Through thorough ecological research and analysis, suitable locations within the wetlands are identified. These areas are selected based on their biodiversity hotspots, ensuring maximum coverage and diversity representation. This strategic deployment optimizes the system's ability to capture a wide array of species.

## üìä Determining Camera Quantity

The project meticulously calculates the number of cameras required for effective coverage. Factors such as terrain, ecosystem diversity, and spatial distribution of wildlife are taken into account. By employing a balanced approach, BioTrace aims to strike a harmonious balance between optimal coverage and resource efficiency.

## üß† AI Processing Hub for Data Analysis

The backbone of BioTrace lies in its AI processing hub. This central unit processes the data collected from cameras and sound sensors, employing sophisticated algorithms to identify species and record population numbers. Through continuous learning, the AI enhances its accuracy in species recognition, providing valuable insights into biodiversity trends.

Through its multifaceted approach, BioTrace stands as an innovative solution that not only improves biodiversity tracking in wetlands but also sets the stage for advancements in conservation efforts by leveraging technology and data-driven methodologies.
